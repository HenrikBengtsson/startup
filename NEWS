Package: startup
================

Version: 0.3.0-9000 [2016-12-18]
o Now it is possible to do negated filename specifications, e.g.
  hpc,package=future/os!=windows.
o Filename flags can now be specified a TRUE, FALSE, T, F, 1, and 0
  (non-case sensitive), e.g. interactive=false and interactive=0.
o Added element 'gui' to sysinfo().
o Added flags 'rstudio' and 'wine' to sysinfo() indicating whether
  R runs via RStudio and via Linux Wine, respectively.
o New conditional <key>=<value> specification: Directory and file
  names containing a package=<name> specification will only be
  processed if and only if package <name> is installed.
o Errors occuring while sourcing an Rprofile file now also
  contain information about in file the error occurred.
  Lines with invalid syntax in Renviron files are ignored with
  a message outputted saying so.  Due to limitations in how
  base::readRenviron() works, it is not possible to detect these
  errors nor capture the outputted message.
o startup(debug = TRUE) now outputs timestamps since start per entry.
o BUG FIX: Now R_STARTUP_DEBUG=TRUE also works for Rscript.  Used
  to only work for the R executable.
  

Version: 0.3.0 [2016-11-21]
o No updates.  First submission to CRAN.


Version: 0.2.0 [2016-11-20]

  the corresponding startup file needs to exist in the same
  location as the directory in order for the directory to be
  processed.


Version: 0.1.0 [2016-11-15]
o Package created. Adopted from a specialized .Rprofile script.
