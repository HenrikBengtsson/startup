Package: startup
================

Version: 0.10.0-9000 [2018-04-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added mytoolbox() for organizing personal tools in separate "toolbox"
   environments on the search path.  This way your customized functions
   and variables won't be removed if the global environment is erased.
   
 * Added partial() for creating tweaked version of existing functions by
   overriding one or more of the default arguments.  This is a utility
   function to be used with mytoolbox().

 * startup(debug = TRUE) reports on search path and loaded namespaces,
   and what packages will be attached after startup finishes.
   

Version: 0.10.0 [2018-03-26]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renviron and Rprofile startup files that use <key>=<value> filters with
   non-declared keys are skipped.  Previously they were always processed.
   This update makes it easier to include "secrets", e.g. files in folder
   ~/.Renviron.d/private/SECRET=banana/ will only be included if the
   environment variable 'SECRET' is set to exactly 'banana'.  An informative
   warning, which can be disabled, will be produced by startup 0.10.* until
   startup 0.11.0 is released.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added is_debug_on() which returns TRUE if the startup debug mode is on.
   To control the debug mode, see ?startup::startup.

 * startup(debug = TRUE) reports on several R_* environment variables.
   
 * restart() gained argument 'quiet' for controlling whether the restart
   should be quiet or not.

 * Added flag 'microsoftr' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs in
   Microsoft R Open or not.

 * Added flag 'pqr' to sysinfo() indicating whether running pqR ("A Pretty
   Quick Version of R"), or not.

 * Added flag 'rstudioterm' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs in an
   RStudio Terminal or not.  To test whether R runs via the RStudio Console,
   use the 'rstudio' flag.

 * Added flag 'rtichoke' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs in rtichoke
   (previously known as Rice) or not.  Please stop using the 'rice' flag and
   start using the 'rtichoke' instead (both have identical values).

 * The 'ess' flag of sysinfo() is now based on whether "ESSR" in search() or
   not - used to check for environment variable 'EMACS' equaling "t" or not.

 * Now startup::restart() also work when running R via 'rtichoke'.

BUG FIX:

 * startup::restart() would not work in the RStudio Terminal.  Note that it
   does not work in the RStudio Console due to limitations in RStudio.

 * On Windows, startup::startup() would produce a false warning on non-existing
   'R_LIBS_USER' folders.


Version: 0.9.0 [2018-01-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added restart() for restarting the current R session.  It can also be used
   to adjust various R command-line arguments and environment variables, e.g.
   restart(as = "R CMD build") mimics the 'R CMD build' setup as far as
   possible.


Version: 0.8.0 [2017-10-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added startup::current_script() which returns the .Rprofile.d/ pathname
   that is currently processed by startup::startup().
   
 * Added flag 'rice' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs via Rice or not,
   meaning it can be used as a file and directory name tag, e.g. rice=TRUE.
 
 * startup(debug = TRUE) outputs much more information on what has taken place
   and what will take place through R's startup process.

 * startup() gained argument 'check' for controlling whether the content of
   startup files should be validated or not.

 * check(), and therefore also startup(check = TRUE), warns if R_LIBS,
   R_LIBS_SITE, or R_LIBS_USER specifies non-existing directory.
   

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * DEFUNCT: renviron() and rprofile() are defunct.  Removed api()$renviron()
   and api()$rprofile().  Use renviron_d() and rprofile_d() instead.

BUG FIXES:

 * Now install(backup = TRUE) guarantees that the .Rprofile file is backed up,
   otherwise an error is produced.  Previously it could silently fail if a
   backup file with the exact same name already existed.

Version: 0.7.0 [2017-09-04]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package requires R (>= 2.14.0; Oct 2011) - was R (>= 2.13.0; Apr 2011).

NEW FEATURES:

 * Convenient session details are now gathered and recorded as R options
   immediately after processing '.Renviron.d' files.  These options, prefixed
   'startup.session.', are available while processing '.Rprofile.d' files and,
   by default, also after startup::startup() has completed.  For information
   on session details recorded, see help("startup_session_options").

 * Added a package vignette (available only in R >= 3.0.2).
 
 
Version: 0.6.1 [2017-05-16]

BUG FIXES:

 * startup() ignores more of the hidden files and folders that macOS may create
   and which should not be sourced during startup.  For instance, when copying
   a file 'foo.R' to a non-macOS file system, an auxillary file '._foo.R' may
   be created as well.
 

Version: 0.6.0 [2017-04-30]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package requires R (>= 2.13.0; Apr 2011) - was R (>= 2.12.0; Oct 2010).

NEW FEATURES:

 * New conditional <key>=<value> specification: an unknown '<key>' (i.e. one
   that is not one of the known sysinfo() fields or 'package') will be
   interpreted as the name of an environment variable.  For instance, files
   path/LANGUAGE=en/*.R will be included only if system environment variable
   LANGUAGE equals 'en' (or is not set).

 * startup::install() now injects 'try(startup::startup())' such that 
   install.packages("startup") will work even when 'startup' is not installed,
   e.g. after a major-version R update.

 * startup::install() and startup::uninstall() now output messages on what is
   done and why, and they now return the R startup file modified. They also
   produce a warning if startup is already installed or uninstalled,
   respectively.

 * startup::install() gained argument 'overwrite' to control whether to append
   (default) to a pre-existing R startup file or to overwrite it.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Backups now assert that not only the backup files are created,
   but also that they have the same file size as the original file.


Version: 0.5.0 [2017-02-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Startup directory or file names that start with two or more periods are now
   excluded, e.g. ~/.Rprofile.d/..hide/test.R.

 * startup() protects against attempts to update R packages also via
   pacman::p_up() in addition to utils::update.packages().

 * Added flag 'ess' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs under Emacs Speaks
   Statistics (ESS) or not.

 * startup(debug = TRUE) detects if R_TESTS is set and reports which the file
   is and that the base package has already processed it.

BUG FIXES:

 * Now startup() ignores macOS files named .DS_Store and directories named
   __MACOSX (and their content).  Previously, such files could result
   in startup errors.
 

Version: 0.4.0 [2016-12-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now it is possible to do negated filename specifications, e.g.
   hpc,package=future/os!=windows.
   
 * Filename flags can now be specified a TRUE, FALSE, T, F, 1, and 0 (non-case
   sensitive), e.g. interactive=false and interactive=0.
   
 * Added element 'gui' to sysinfo().
 
 * Added flags 'rstudio' and 'wine' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs via
   RStudio and via Linux Wine, respectively.
   
 * New conditional <key>=<value> specification: Directory and file names
   containing a package=<name> specification will be processed if and only if
   package <name> is installed.
   
 * Errors occurring while sourcing an Rprofile file now also contain
   information about in file the error occurred.  Lines with invalid syntax in
   Renviron files are ignored with a message outputted saying so.  Due to
   limitations in how base::readRenviron() works, it is not possible to detect
   these errors nor capture the outputted message.
  
 * Now objects are auto printed to match the behavior of the R startup process.
  
 * startup(debug = TRUE) now outputs time stamps since start per entry.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * DEPRECATED: renviron() and rprofile() were renamed to renviron_d() and
   rprofile_d(), respectively.

BUG FIXES:

 * A file extension *.R would incorrectly become part of the <value> in a
   trailing <key>=<value> specification.
  
 * Now R_STARTUP_DEBUG=TRUE also works for Rscript; used to work only for the
   R executable.

 * Some macOS backup files would not be filtered out when running on Windows.
 

Version: 0.3.0 [2016-11-21]

 * No updates.  First submission to CRAN.


Version: 0.2.0 [2016-11-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add arguments sibling = FALSE to startup().  If sibling = TRUE, the
   corresponding startup file needs to exist in the same location as the
   directory in order for the directory to be processed.


Version: 0.1.0 [2016-11-15]

 * Package created. Adopted from a specialized .Rprofile script.
