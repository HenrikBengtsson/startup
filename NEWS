Package: startup
================

Version: 0.4.0-9000 [2017-02-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Startup directory or file names that start with two or more periods
   are now excluded, e.g. ~/.Rprofile.d/..hide/test.R.

 o startup() protects against attempts to update R packages also via
   pacman::p_up() in addition to utils::update.packages().

 o Added flag 'ess' to sysinfo() indicating whether R runs under Emacs
   Speaks Statistics (ESS) or not.

 o startup(debug = TRUE) detects if R_TESTS is set and reports which the
   file is and that the base package has already processed it.
   

BUG FIXES:

 o Now startup() ignores macOS files name .DS_Store and directories named
   `__MACOSX` (and their content).  Previously, such files could result
   in startup errors.
 

Version: 0.4.0 [2016-12-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now it is possible to do negated filename specifications, e.g.
   hpc,package=future/os!=windows.
   
 o Filename flags can now be specified a TRUE, FALSE, T, F, 1, and 0
   (non-case sensitive), e.g. interactive=false and interactive=0.
   
 o Added element 'gui' to sysinfo().
 
 o Added flags 'rstudio' and 'wine' to sysinfo() indicating whether
   R runs via RStudio and via Linux Wine, respectively.
   
 o New conditional <key>=<value> specification: Directory and file
   names containing a package=<name> specification will only be
   processed if and only if package <name> is installed.
   
 o Errors occuring while sourcing an Rprofile file now also
   contain information about in file the error occurred.
   Lines with invalid syntax in Renviron files are ignored with
   a message outputted saying so.  Due to limitations in how
   base::readRenviron() works, it is not possible to detect these
   errors nor capture the outputted message.
  
 o Now objects are autoprinted to match the behavior of the R startup
   process.
  
 o startup(debug = TRUE) now outputs timestamps since start per entry.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 o DEPRECATED: renviron() and rprofile() were renamed to renviron_d()
   and rprofile_d(), respectively.

BUG FIXES:

 o BUG FIX: A file extension *.R would incorrectly become part of
   the <value> in a trailing <key>=<value> specification.
  
 o BUG FIX: Now R_STARTUP_DEBUG=TRUE also works for Rscript.  Used
   to only work for the R executable.
  

Version: 0.3.0 [2016-11-21]

 o No updates.  First submission to CRAN.


Version: 0.2.0 [2016-11-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Add arguments sibling = FALSE to startup().  If sibling = TRUE,
   the corresponding startup file needs to exist in the same
   location as the directory in order for the directory to be
   processed.


Version: 0.1.0 [2016-11-15]

 o Package created. Adopted from a specialized .Rprofile script.
